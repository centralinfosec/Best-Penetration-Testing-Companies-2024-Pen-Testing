# Best Penetration Testing Companies of 2024
This list includes some of the best penetration testing (Pentesting) companies in 2024.

## Penetration Testing Overview

### What Is A Penetration Test?
Penetration testing is a type of security testing that identifies vulnerabilities, threats, and risks in networks, systems, and applications. While vulnerability scanning attempts to identify known vulnerabilities, penetration tests are intended to exploit the weaknesses to gain full situational awareness when it comes to cybersecurity including organizational risk, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential business impact.

### Why Do I Need A Penetration Test?
Penetration testing can evaluate your security controls and provide you with recommendations to enhance your overall security posture. Penetration testing can include real-world security tests using advanced hacking methods to help you identify your weaknesses and improve your security posture. Advanced penetration tests can also simulate attacks on your network using similar techniques as malicious attackers to see if you can identify active attacks!

### Why You Need Independent Security Testing
Organizations benefit from independent security testing. Not every business has their own internal team of security professionals, and even those that do, could benefit from a fresh set of eyes. Routine penetration tests can help identify your vulnerabilities, help determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities, help gauge the potential impact of vulnerabilities, help access organization risk, help prioritize your remediation efforts, help you meet regulatory and compliance standards, help you explain security concerns to technical engineers and application developers, and help you justify security-related initiatives to executive leadership.

### How Often Do I Need Security Testing?
There is no magic number that fits every organization. Routine penetration testing should be performed to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Annual penetration tests are not enough. Monthly or quarterly penetration tests, along with weekly or monthly vulnerability scanning are much more effective at improving your overall security posture. Penetration testing should also be performed after network changes, application updates, and when new systems are brought onto the network.

### Areas That Should Receive Penetration Testing
The following areas at a minimum should receive routine penetration testing:
 - External Network Penetration Testing
 - Internal Network Penetration Testing
 - Web Application Penetration Testing
 - Mobile Application Penetration Testing
 - Physical Penetration Testing
 - Wireless Penetration Testing
 - Social Engineering Penetration Testing
 - Cloud Penetration Testing
